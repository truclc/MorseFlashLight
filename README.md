Morse Flash Light is an application designed for smartwatches that allows you to use the device's screen brightness to transmit Morse code signals. The app adjusts the brightness of the smartwatch screen to create light signals following Morse code, enabling you to send messages without sound.

## Key Features:
- **Text to Morse Conversion**: Enter text, and the app will automatically convert it into Morse code.
- **Screen Brightness Signaling**: Uses the smartwatch's screen brightness to transmit light signals.
- **Compact and Easy to Use**: Optimized for smartwatch screens, with a simple and user-friendly interface.
- **Emergency Communication**: Ideal for use in situations where sound-based communication is not possible, such as emergencies or quiet environments.

This app is particularly useful in scenarios where sound cannot be used, providing a discreet way to communicate through light signals.
